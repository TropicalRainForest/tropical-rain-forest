											<h3>Plant Life</h3>
										</header>
										<p>More than two thirds of the world’s plant life is found in tropical rainforests. They provide shelter and food for rainforest life. These plants survive in a warm humid environment that allows for more variation, like the tualang. Plants have evolved to growing on trees to survive as there is a lot of competition on the ground level.</p>

										<p>One example is the Buttress Roots. Most rainforest soil is very poor with all the nutrients available largely remaining at surface level. Because of this rainforest trees have very shallow roots. The extended roots can increase the area of where nutrients can be absorbed. This is one of the many examples of adaptations in the rain forest. </p>
										
										<p> Another example of the adaption of plants are lianas, which are climbing woody vines that drape rainforest trees. They have adapted to life in the rainforest by having their roots in the ground and climbing high into the tree canopy to reach available sunlight.  Many lianas start life in the rainforest canopy and send roots down to the ground.</p>
										
										<p>Another example is an Orchid. One of the most abundant and varied of plant families. Although temperate orchids usually grow in the soil, tropical orchids are more often epiphytes which grow non-parasitically on trees. They have adapted this way to take advantage of the sunlight in the canopy. </p>
									
										<p> Questions:</p>
									
										<p>How have buttress roots adapted? </p>
										
										<p> How much of the world’s plant life is found in tropical rain forests?</p>

											<h3>Animal Life</h3>
										</header>
														<p>Animals in the rainforest have cleverly adapted to their environment, one adaption of animals in the tropical rainforest is camouflage. For example the tree sloth combines expert cover with slow-motion movement to dodge predators such as the jaguar. A sloth's fur is covered with green algae so it blends with the environment. It is the world's slowest moving animal and takes up to a month to digest its food, so it doesn't need many resources to survive. The sloth is a primary consumer, because it is a herbivore.</p>
										
										<p>Another adaption can be seen by the size and stature of rainforest animals. For example, jaguars adapted with a small but stocky build that makes them speedy hunters and small enough to sleep in trees. Jaguars are carnivores.</p>
										
										<p>The flying fox bat and the leopard cat have also all made an extra special adaption. The adaptation to night hunting gives these nocturnal animals the benefit of reduced competition for food. Leopard cats are carnivores.</p>
										
										<p>In terms of dietary adaptations, toucans (which are herbivores) have adapted to a limited diet so they don't face competition for food. Toucans snag hard-to-reach fruit, which are inaccessible to other feathered flyers with their long, narrow beaks.</p>
										
										<p>Decomposers play a vital role in every biome, including the tropical rain forest (see the glossary for more information on decomposers). Important decomposers in the tropical rain forest biome include: Termites, Leaf Beetles, Worms, Oyster Mushrooms (Fungi), Cup Fungus, Velvet Worm, Partula Snail, Fungi, and Ants.</p>
									
										<p>Questions:</p>
									
										<p>How has the sloth adapted to its environment?</p>
										
										<p>Name two decomposers found in the tropical rain forest?</p>

											<h3>Human Impact</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Humans can use some of the plants produced in the rainforest as medicine. Also the natural plants found in the rainforests bring more money than the industry that is trying to replace the rainforests which would be for farming. Farmers can use the land from the rainforests as there is healthy soil for the plants to grow quickly. Keeping the rainforests though would be much more efficient as more money would essentially come from that than the farming industry. Deforestation is a harmful thing that humans do towards the rainforests.  As mentioned above cutting out the rainforest would not be a good idea as it is not efficient enough. Over exploitation is also harmful to the rainforest and the environment since the rainforest itself gives healthy soil and ⅔ of the world’s plants. The rainforest also gives a wide variety of plant so killing off the rainforest would ruin that. From rainforests, humans get what they need, but the rainforest itself doesn’t get much out of it.</p>
										
										<p>Questions:</p>
									
										<p>Name one way humans benefit from tropical rainforests.</p>
										
										<p>Name one way humans have caused harm to tropical rainforests.</p>

											<h3>Environment</h3>
										</header>
										<p>In terms of geological features, the tropical rainforest consists mainly of moss and other lush plantation, rocks, trees, healthy soil, and grasses.  The actual land of a rainforest is usually quite rocky, and rainforests often cover hills and small mountains.  Despite the lack of light that reaches the forest floor, countless species of plants, animals, and insects continue to thrive in this biome.</p>

										<p>Rainfall is more than frequent in  tropical rainforests, in which rain falls nearly every day.  On average about 2500 millimetres of rain falls annually.  This, along with the constant temperature hanging around 25-30 degrees Celsius, makes the rainforest an extremely humid place.  Tropical rain forests receive almost 12 hours of sunlight every day.  Since a lot of sunlight seeps into the rainforest, a large amount of energy is stored by plants and then later eaten by animals, creating a more lively and thriving ecosystem for both plants and animals in this biome.</p>
