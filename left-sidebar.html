													<h3>Animals</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Ridiculously huge numbers of animals live in rainforests, including microscopic animals, invertebrates (like insects and worms), fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. The different rainforests of the world support different populations of animals. A few animals from each rainforest are: sloths, bats, leopards, spider monkeys, chimpanzees and much much more. Animals in the rainforest have made many adaptations as can be seen from their diet, size, stature and camouflaging abilities.

													<h3>Plants</h3>
												</header>
												<p>More than two thirds of the world’s plant life is found in tropical rainforests. They provide shelter and food for rainforest life. These plants survive in a warm humid environment that allows for more variation, like the tualang. Most rainforest soil is very poor with all the nutrients available largely remaining at surface level. Because of this rainforest trees have very shallow roots and extended roots to increase the area of where nutrients can be absorbed.</p>

													<h3>The Tropical Rain Forest: Important Terms And Definitions</h3>
												</header>
											<p>Buttress - Because the soil is not very fertile in rainforests, the taller trees have developed buttress roots. These roots give extra support for the tree, which is not able to grow deep rooting systems that such a tall tree would ordinarily grow to stabilize.</p>
<p>Conservation - Is the preservation of natural species and environments from excessive exploitation by humans. This involves help from citizens, governments and scientists.</p>
<p>Deforestation - The destruction or clearing of a forest; the long-term or permanent removal of forests.</p>
<p>Ecosystem - A biologically interdependent region that may be as small as a pond or as big as a planet.</p>
<p>Emergent - The uppermost layer of trees in the rainforest are also known as the dominants. This fourth layer consisting of the tops of the tallest trees.</p>
<p>Equator - It is an imaginary line between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere also known as the Tropic of Cancer.</p>
<p>Extinction - Occurs when the very last member of any species dies out. This can be caused by the destruction of its habitat, over hunting or a failure to compete with predators.</p>
<p>Forest floor - Is the first level of a rainforest. This is the ground layer made up of tree roots, soil and decaying matter.</p>
<p>Greenhouse effect - The heating of the lower atmosphere that occurs when carbon dioxide traps heat that would otherwise escape into space.</p>
<p>Species - Is a type of race or breed. A group of plants or animals that are able to produce new plants or animals sharing the same traits of its predecessor.</p>
<p>Topsoil - Is the soil above the stony ground. This earth is held in place by the trees. Once the trees are cut down the soil is washed away by rains.</p>
<p> Tropical rainforest - Is an evergreen forest located at low elevations in regions between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Abundant rainfall and very warm weather characterize tropical rainforests. This is why there are so many different types of vegetation there. </p>
<p> Understory - The forest layer below the canopy that includes small trees & young canopy trees. This is the second layer of a rainforest. </p>

											<h3>Environment</h3>
										</header>
										<p>In terms of geological features, the tropical rainforest consists mainly of moss and other lush plantation, rocks, trees, healthy soil, and grasses.  Rainfall is very frequent, and on average about 2500 millimetres of rain falls annually.  This, along with the constant temperature hanging around 25-30 degrees Celsius, makes the rainforest an extremely humid place.

											<h3>Human Impact</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Plants produced in the rainforest are used as medicine.Farmers can use the land from the rainforests as there is healthy soil for the plants to grow quickly. Deforestation is a harmful thing that humans do towards the rainforests. Over exploitation is also harmful to the rainforest and the environment since the rainforest itself gives healthy soil and ⅔ of the world’s plants.

											<h3>Medical Impact</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Rainforests are a rich source of medicines. In fact, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, more than two-thirds of all medicines found to have cancer-fighting properties come from rainforest plants. Some of the compounds in rainforest plants are also used to treat malaria, heart disease, diabetes, muscle tension, arthritis, glaucoma, dysentery and tuberculosis, among other health problems.
