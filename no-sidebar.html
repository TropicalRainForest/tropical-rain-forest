					<p>Adaptation: A body part or behavior that helps a plant or animal to survive</p>
					<p>Amphibious: Capable of living on both land and water for at least a portion of its life</p>
					cycle</p>
					<p>Arboreal: An animal that lives in, or is adapted to living in trees</p>
					<p>Arthropod: A group of animals that have exoskeletons, jointed legs, and segmented
					bodies; includes such animals as insects, spiders, ticks, centipedes, millipedes, crawfish,
					lobsters, and scorpions</p>
					<p>Biodiversity: The term for the variety of life and the natural processes of which living
					things are a part. This includes the living organisms and the genetic differences between
					them and the communities in which they occur. The concept of biodiversity represents
					the ways that life is organized and interacts on our planet. These interactions can take
					place on scales ranging from the smallest, at the chromosome level, to organisms,
					ecosystems, and even to entire landscapes.</p>
					<p>Bromeliad: A tropical plant in the same family as the pineapple; it often grows on the
					limbs and trunks of trees.</p>
					<p>Buttress: The broadened base of a tree trunk that helps to support the tree</p>
					<p>Calls: Animal vocalizations to other animals that are not songs. Calls are made during
					courtship, feeding, and migration or as warnings.</p>
					<p>Camouflage: Protective coloration or shape that helps to hide an animal from its
					predators or prey</p>
					<p>Canopy: The layer of the forest formed by the crown of tall trees, often 65-100 feet (20-
					30 meters) tall</p>
					<p>Carnivore: An animal that eats only other animals; also an order of mammals that
					includes bears, cats, raccoons and the weasel family</p>
					<p>Carrion: Dead and decaying flesh</p>
					<p>Condensation: The process of changing from a gaseous to a liquid or solid state</p>
					<p>Conservation: Planned management of a natural resource to prevent over-exploitation,
					destruction, or neglect</p>
					<p>Consumer: An animal that eats other plants or animals in a food chain</p>
					<p>Decomposer: Organisms, bacteria and fungi that feed on and break down organic
					substances such as dead plants and animals</p>
					<p>Deforestation: The destruction of a forest often caused by slash-and-burn agriculture,
					cattle ranching, timber harvesting and development</p>
					<p>Detritus: Dead plant, animal and other organic material</p>
					<p>Ecosystem: A community of organisms (plants and animals), interacting with each other
					and the non-living things in their environment</p>
					<p>Ectotherm: An animal that maintains its body temperature within fairly narrow limits by
					behavioral means such as basking or seeking shade</p>
					<p>Endangered species: Organisms that face extinction</p>
					<p>Endotherm: An animal that is able to maintain a body temperature that varies only
					within narrow limits by means of internal mechanisms, (i.e. sweating, panting, or
					shivering). Birds and mammals are endotherms.</p>
					<p>Energy Flow: The path of the energy in a food chain or web, originating in the sun,
					utilized by plants in creating food, then utilized by animals, through eating the plants and
					through eating those that eat the plant. Some of the energy is lost at each level of the
					chain.</p>
					<p>Epiphyte: A plant that grows on other plants, but does not take nutrition from the host.
					The roots of many epiphytes can absorb water and nutrients from the air or rain.</p>
					<p>Food Chain: The transfer of energy from the sun to plants to plant-eating animals, to
					animals that eat them, and so on. Each organism can be described by its position in the
					energy flow.</p>
					<p>Food Web: A model more complex than a food chain that shows the relationship of
					plants and animals to each other. While a food chain will have one representative, a food
					web shows the multiple organisms that are interacting at each level.</p>
					<p>Fungi: A diverse group of mainly terrestrial organisms separated from other plants by
					their lack of chlorophyll. They are generally saprophytic or parasitic.</p>
					<p>Greenhouse effect: The heating of the lower atmosphere that occurs when carbon
					dioxide traps heat that would otherwise escape into space</p>
					<p>Habitat: The environment in which an organism lives</p>
					<p>Herbivore: An animal that eats only plants</p>
					<p>Humidity: The amount of water vapor in the air</p>
					<p>Insectivore: An insect eater</p>
					<p>Invertebrate: An animal without a backbone</p>
					<p>Keratin: An organic material that is the base for hair, nails, hooves, and the exoskeletons
					of arthropods</p>
					<p>Life Cycle: The sequence of changes making up the span of an organismâ€™s life from the
					fertilization of gametes to the same stage in the subsequent generation</p>
					<p>Metamorphosis: The change of an insect (or other animal) from one form to another as it
					develops into an adult</p>
					<p>Mimicry: The way one organism looks like another organism or natural object in order to
					gain some advantage, such as protection</p>
					<p>Mutualism: Interaction of two or more species that benefits both partners. See symbiosis.</p>
					<p>Niche: The function or role of a given species in a community</p>
					<p>Parasite: An organism that grows, feeds, and is sheltered on or in a different organism
					while contributing nothing to the survival of its host. The tolerance of the host varies
					from being almost unaffected to serious illness and often death.</p>
					<p>Photosynthesis: The process by which green plants synthesize carbohydrates (food) from
					carbon dioxide and water using light as an energy source, and releasing oxygen as a
					byproduct.</p>
					<p>Pollination: The transfer of pollen to the pistil of a flower</p>
					<p>Precipitation: Any form of water, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail that falls to the earth's
					surface</p>
					<p>Predator: An organism that captures another organism to obtain food</p>
					<p>Secondary Consumer: Refers to a predator; an animal that does not take nourishment
					directly from the plant but from those who feed upon the plant</p>
					<p>Skeleton: A hard structure that supports and maintains the shape of an animal. It may be
					external to the body (exoskeleton) or within the body (endoskeleton).</p>
					<p>Specialization: A species may be so suited to its environment that it cannot change easily
					when the environment changes. This species is called specialized; particularly suited to
					its environment.</p>
