											<h3>World Map</h3>

										<p>For this picture, it shows the rainforests that are around the world. There are many rainforests are found in South America. There are the Central American Rainforests and the Amazon Rainforest south America. Another major rainforest is in Africa called the Congo River Basin Rainforest. Another rainforest in Africa is called Madagascar Rainforest. In Asia the major rainforest is called the South East Asian Rainforests. The last major rainforest is found in Australia.

											<h3>Food Chain</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This picture just goes to show the different types of animals that can be found in the rainforest and their each individual group. The chain itself is not shown, but it can be inferred about which animal would what the plant and which animal would eat that one. There can be many different chains made from this chart as it shows the many consumers in each group. One example for a chain would be Shrubs Flowers as the Primary Producers.  Insects that would eat that plant would be called primary consumers. Amphibians would eat those insects making it the secondary consumer. The tertiary consumer would then be like a cougar who would eat the secondary consumer. This is just one of the many food chains that can be formed from this chart.</p>

											<h3>Energy Pyramid</h3>
										</header>
										<p>This picture explains how much energy is transferred from one group to another. The bottom of the pyramid is the producer which are basically just plants. The next group would be the primary consumer which in this case is like a small worm. the next group is the secondary consumer which in this case is a gorilla. The final group would be the tertiary consumer which in this case happens to be a jaguar.</p>
